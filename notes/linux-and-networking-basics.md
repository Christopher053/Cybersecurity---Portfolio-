# Linux and Networking Basics

## Why Linux is Important in Cybersecurity
Linux is widely used in cybersecurity because many servers, security tools, and penetration testing environments are built on Linux. Understanding Linux helps security professionals manage systems, analyze logs, and use security tools effectively.

## Basic Linux Concepts
- Files and directories
- Permissions (read, write, execute)
- Users and groups
- Command-line interface (CLI)

## Common Linux Commands
- `ls` – list files and directories
- `cd` – change directory
- `pwd` – show current directory
- `cp` – copy files
- `mv` – move or rename files
- `rm` – remove files
- `chmod` – change file permissions

## Networking Basics
Networking is the foundation of how computers communicate. Understanding networking helps in detecting attacks, securing systems, and troubleshooting network issues.

## Key Networking Concepts
- IP address
- MAC address
- Ports
- Protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS)
- LAN and WAN

## Common Networking Commands
- `ip a` / `ifconfig` – view network interfaces
- `ping` – test network connectivity
- `netstat` / `ss` – view network connections
- `traceroute` – trace network path

## What I Have Learned
I learned the importance of Linux in cybersecurity, basic command-line usage, and fundamental networking concepts that support secure communication between systems.

## Next Steps
- Practice Linux commands regularly
- Learn about network scanning tools
- Explore packet analysis basics
